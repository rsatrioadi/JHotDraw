# JHotDraw Preservation Commentaries

## JHotDraw version 5.1 (13 September 1997)

This Git repository is a preservation of the JHotDraw framework, created originally by Erich Gamma. This framework is often used as case study in software engineering research.

This repository contains all the available versions (so far) of JHotDraw, starting from 5.1 to 7.6. There are two branches in this repository:

* `original` contains all the original files of the JHotDraw project, including distributed binaries and JavaDoc-generated documentation, in its original directory structure.
* `clean` is where you can see this README file. This branch contains only the source files, non-generated documentation, external dependencies, and sample drawing files. Binary files (.class, .jar) are removed. The directories are restructured for familiarity and consistency.
